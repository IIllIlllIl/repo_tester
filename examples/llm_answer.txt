Okay, so I need to come up with at least five test assertions for the base32_encode method in Python. Let me start by understanding what the method does.

The method takes bytes data as input and returns a bytes object. It's supposed to encode the data into base32. From the method's code, I can see that it's processing the input data by converting each byte into its binary representation, then into an 8-bit string. It's then splitting this into 5-byte chunks, and each chunk is converted to a corresponding base32 character. Finally, the result is padded to 8 bytes.

Now, for the test assertions, I should think about normal, boundary, and abnormal cases. The method's input is bytes, which in Python can be of arbitrary length, so I need to test various scenarios where the input might be empty, have multiple of 5 bytes, or not.

First, the normal case is straightforward. I'll test when the input is "Hello World!" which should return a specific base32 string. The assert assert等于条件来验证这个结果。

Next, the boundary case. If the input length is a multiple of 5, the method should still process it correctly. For example, a string of 10 bytes should split into two 5-byte chunks. I'll need to make sure both chunks are processed correctly and the result is as expected.

Then, the abnormal case. I'll consider an empty string as input. What should happen? The method's code handles it by converting each byte into a binary string, which remains empty, then padding it. So the result should be an empty bytes object. I'll assert that.

Also, what happens if the input is longer than what can be padded? For instance, if the length isn't a multiple of 8, the method will pad with '='. So a string that can't be padded should have the correct output.

Wait, the method uses a list of B32_CHARSET, which is a string of characters. The index is taken using chunk. So I should make sure that when chunk is beyond the length of B32_CHARSET, it throws an error, but in Python, it just returns an empty string, which will still produce a base32 encoded result. Wait, no, because the length of B32_CHARSET is 32, so any chunk index beyond 31 will wrap around. Hmm, but the method expects each chunk to be a string, so if someone passes a chunk beyond the length, it'll handle it, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that but perhaps the test cases don't go that far.

So the assertions would cover these three cases: normal, boundary, and abnormal input. I'll write each assertion as an assert statement comparing the actual output with the expected result.

Wait, the method's return is bytes, so the assert will need to compare the two bytes objects directly.

Let me structure this:

1. Test normal case: input is "Hello World!", expected output as provided.

2. Test boundary case: input is "123456" (6 bytes), expecting the correct 6 bytes.

3. Test empty input: input is an empty bytes object, expecting empty bytes.

4. Test abnormal case: input is a longer string that doesn't fit neatly into 5-byte chunks, like 7 bytes. After processing, the 7-byte data would be split into one 5-byte chunk and one 2-byte chunk. The method would pad the chunks and process them, resulting in a certain output.

5. Test maximum possible length: an 8-byte input. Since 8 is a multiple of 8, it's processed correctly.

But wait, 8 bytes would be two 5-byte chunks. Let me see: 5 and 3 bytes, so the first chunk is 5 bytes, the second is 3 bytes. The second chunk would need to be padded to 5 bytes, resulting in two characters, then the first chunk is processed, and the second chunk is padded with '='.

Hmm, but the method uses ljust to pad the chunks to 8 bytes. So for an 8-byte input, the first 5 bytes are processed, and the next 3 bytes are padded to 5, resulting in two chunks. The first chunk is 5 bytes, and the second is 5 bytes. The second chunk would have the first 3 bytes as is, and the last 2 padded with 0s, but since the chunk is 3 bytes, which is less than 5, it's treated as 3 bytes, so the padding is added. Wait, no, the chunk is taken from binary_data, which is the 8-byte processed, then zfilled to 8. So for 8 bytes, each 5-byte chunk is taken from the 8-byte processed data, which is 8 bytes. So the first 5 bytes form the first chunk, the next 3 bytes form the second chunk, which is then padded to 5 bytes with '='.

But the base32 result for 2 chunks would be 10 bytes, with the second chunk's padding '='.

I think this covers the cases. So five assertions, three main types: normal, boundary, and abnormal.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to test the `base32_encode` method in Python to ensure it behaves correctly under normal, boundary, and abnormal input conditions. We will generate test assertions using `pytest` style `assert` statements to validate the method's output.

### Approach
The method `base32_encode` takes a bytes object as input and returns a base32 encoded bytes object. The encoding process involves converting the input bytes into binary strings, splitting them into 5-byte chunks, and then mapping each chunk to a corresponding base32 character. The result is then padded to 8 bytes.

For test assertions, we need to consider three main scenarios:
1. **Normal Case**: Input data is "Hello World!" which should return the expected base32 string.
2. **Boundary Case**: Input data is "123456" which has a length divisible by 5 and should be encoded correctly.
3. **Abnormal Case**: Input data is an empty bytes object, expecting an empty result.
4. **Abnormal Case**: Input data is an 8-byte object, which is expected to return a specific encoded result.
5. **Abnormal Case**: Input data is a string with a length that is not a multiple of 5, requiring proper padding with '='.

### Solution Code
```python
def base32_encode(data: bytes) -> bytes:
    binary_data = "".join(bin(ord(d))[2:].zfill(8) for d in data.decode("utf-8"))
    binary_data = binary_data.ljust(5 * ((len(binary_data) // 5) + 1), "0")
    b32_chunks = map("".join, zip(*[iter(binary_data)] * 5))
    b32_result = "".join(B32_CHARSET[int(chunk, 2)] for chunk in b32_chunks)
    return bytes(b32_result.ljust(8 * ((len(b32_result) // 8) + 1), "="), "utf-8")

# Test assertions
assert base32_encode("Hello World!") == b'JBSWY3DPEBLW64TMMQQQ====', "Normal case - 'Hello World!' encoded correctly."
assert base32_encode("123456") == b'GEZDGNBVGY======', "Boundary case - '123456' encoded correctly."
assert base32_encode(b""), b'', "Abnormal case - Empty input results in empty bytes."
assert base32_encode(b"some long complex string") == b'ONXW2ZJANRXW4ZZAMNXW24DMMV4CA43UOJUW4ZY=', "Boundary case - 'some long complex string' encoded correctly."
assert base32_encode(b"any length") == b'KQ==', "Abnormal case - Input of length 1 results in padded '=' characters."
```

### Explanation
1. **Normal Case**: The input "Hello World!" is processed to ensure it results in the expected base32 encoded string.
2. **Boundary Case**: The input "123456" (6 bytes) is split into two 5-byte chunks, each processed correctly.
3. **Abnormal Case**: An empty input results in an empty bytes object, which is correctly tested.
4. **Abnormal Case**: An 8-byte input is split into two 5-byte chunks, with the second chunk padded to 8 bytes with '='.
5. **Abnormal Case**: A string with length not a multiple of 5 results in proper padding with '='.

Each assertion uses the `assert` statement to verify the output of `base32_encode` against the expected result, ensuring the method behaves as expected under various input conditions.
